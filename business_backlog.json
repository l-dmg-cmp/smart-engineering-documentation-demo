The report is organized by card number and includes transaction details such as transaction ID, account ID, transaction type, category, source, and amount. The program calculates and displays running totals at three levels: page totals, account totals, and grand totals for transaction amounts. For example, if transactions of $100, $200, and $300 exist for a card, the account total would be $600. If this spans two pages with $300 on each, there would be page totals of $300 each. Business rules include: (1) Transactions are only included if their processing timestamp falls within the specified date range, (2) When a new card number is encountered, account totals for the previous card are printed, (3) Page totals are printed when a page is full (after 20 detail lines).

These lookups are performed using VSAM indexed files with random access mode. The business rule requires that all lookups must be successful - if any lookup fails (invalid key), the program displays an error message with the specific key that failed and terminates execution.

For each transaction, the card number is extracted and used as a key to look up the corresponding record in the cross-reference file. If found, the system retrieves the account ID and customer ID associated with the card. This mapping is essential for transaction processing as it connects the physical card used for a transaction with the financial account that should be debited. The lookup uses an indexed file with the card number as the key for efficient retrieval. If the card number is not found in the cross-reference file (indicated by status code 4), the transaction cannot be processed further. The system displays the card number, account ID, and customer ID when a successful lookup occurs, providing an audit trail of the resolution process.",

The component implements comprehensive error handling for all file operations with specific error messages and status codes. For example, if a file open operation fails, the system displays an error message like 'ERROR OPENING [FILE NAME]' along with the specific file status code. The component uses a standardized approach to file status checking, where '00' indicates success and other codes indicate various error conditions. When errors occur, the component calls the Z-DISPLAY-IO-STATUS routine to format and display the file status code in a user-friendly format, then calls Z-ABEND-PROGRAM to terminate execution with error code 999.
