## Description
This copybook defines the security user data structure used in the CardDemo application for AWS mainframe migration. It contains fields for storing user authentication and identification information, including user ID, first name, last name, password, user type, and a filler field. This structure is likely used across multiple programs within the application for user management, authentication, and access control operations.
