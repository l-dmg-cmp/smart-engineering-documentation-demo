# CardDemo Main Menu Interface and Navigation System

## Description
This epic encompasses the development of a comprehensive main menu system for the CardDemo application that provides personalized navigation, maintains session state, and delivers an intuitive user interface. The system will authenticate users, display appropriate menu options based on access levels, handle navigation between application components, manage session context through a commarea structure, validate user inputs, display informative error messages, and ensure a consistent user experience throughout the application. The menu interface will include standard header information, properly formatted menu options, and support for function keys like PF3 for returning to the sign-on screen. This functionality forms the core navigation framework that enables users to efficiently access the various features of the CardDemo application according to their authorization level.
