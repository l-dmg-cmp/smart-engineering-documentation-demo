# User Authentication and Security Management System

## Description
This epic encompasses the development of a comprehensive authentication and security management system for the CardDemo AWS application. It includes secure user authentication with session management, intuitive sign-on interfaces, user registration capabilities, administrative tools for user management, and seamless navigation between security administration screens. The system will enforce proper access controls based on user roles, maintain session context throughout user interactions, and provide administrators with robust tools to create, update, delete and list user accounts. The implementation will focus on data integrity, clear user feedback, and efficient workflows that preserve context during navigation between different security administration functions.
