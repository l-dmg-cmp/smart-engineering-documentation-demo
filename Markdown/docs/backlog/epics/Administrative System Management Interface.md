# Administrative System Management Interface

## Description
This epic focuses on creating a comprehensive administrative interface for the CardDemo AWS application that enables administrators to efficiently manage the system. It encompasses the development of an intuitive menu system with clear navigation paths, robust session management to maintain context throughout administrative workflows, and a structured approach to organizing administrative functions. The interface will provide administrators with a centralized access point to various system management capabilities while ensuring proper authentication, consistent user experience, and reliable state management across all administrative operations. This will allow administrators to effectively perform their duties with minimal friction, improving overall system governance and operational efficiency.
