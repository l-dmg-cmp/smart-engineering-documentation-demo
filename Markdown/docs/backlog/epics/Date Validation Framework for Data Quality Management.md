# Date Validation Framework for Data Quality Management

## Description
Implement a comprehensive date validation framework within the CardDemo application that ensures all date inputs adhere to specified formats and represent valid calendar dates. This framework will provide consistent validation across the application, including format compliance checking, date value validation, numeric validation, and range validation. The system will return detailed validation results with appropriate error codes and messages to calling programs, enabling them to handle validation failures appropriately. This epic aims to enhance data integrity throughout the application by preventing invalid dates from being processed, thereby improving overall data quality management capabilities.
