# Transaction Reporting System Enhancement

## Description
This epic focuses on developing a comprehensive transaction reporting system within the CardDemo application that enables financial analysts and business users to generate, configure, and navigate transaction reports with ease. The system will provide flexible date range options (monthly, yearly, or custom), intuitive navigation between screens while maintaining session context, proper validation of user inputs, and accurate calculation and display of transaction data with appropriate formatting. The enhanced reporting capabilities will allow users to analyze card transaction patterns and provide accurate financial summaries to stakeholders without requiring IT assistance, while maintaining a consistent user experience throughout the reporting workflow.
