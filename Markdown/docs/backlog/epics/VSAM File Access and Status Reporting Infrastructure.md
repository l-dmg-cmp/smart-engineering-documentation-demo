# VSAM File Access and Status Reporting Infrastructure

## Description
This epic focuses on establishing a robust data access infrastructure for the CardDemo AWS application, specifically for handling VSAM file operations. It encompasses the implementation of sequential file reading capabilities for the CARDFILE database to support business reporting needs, along with a standardized file status reporting mechanism across all VSAM operations. The infrastructure will provide consistent error handling, proper status code interpretation, and reliable data access patterns that will serve as the foundation for all file operations within the application. This will enable business analysts to generate accurate reports while giving developers the tools needed to efficiently troubleshoot and maintain the system's data access components during the mainframe modernization process.
